# Budget Tracker

### Problem Statement
I like to go to my bank account and see that I have enough money to go on that
vacation I wanted, or buy that new car I've been looking at for a while. Well,
what if I didn't have that money, or wanted to know where all my money was going
to.

That's where this budget tracker application comes in. It will help figure out
what area I may be spending too much money. Am I spending too much on
transportation costs? Or am I spending too much in recreation/entertainment?
With this application you can see how much you are spending in a few different
categories. Such as: savings/investments, debt, home, transportation, and
recreation/entertainment.
